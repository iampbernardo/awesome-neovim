# awesome-neovim
A curated list of resources that help with my whole Neovim setup (or are related to it)


## Setup
-  [LazzyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim): Nevim setup based on **lazyvim** so you don't have to start everything from scratch. (Recomended by @nhellwig)



## Tools and productivity
- [Telekasten](https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim):  Personal note-taking system I use for my Second Brain. (very similar to a Roam Research / Logseq setup but in Neovim)
